# ui-ux
## Sticky header or any sticky component 
- It use sticky position (combine of relative and fixed position)
- An element with position: sticky; is positioned based on the user's scroll position.
- A sticky element toggles between relative and fixed, depending on the scroll position. It is positioned relative until a given offset position is met in the viewport - then it "sticks" in place (like position:fixed).
- Note: You must specify at least one of top, right, bottom or left for sticky positioning to work.
